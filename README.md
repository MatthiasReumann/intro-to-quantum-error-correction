# An Incomplete Introduction to Quantum Error Correction

The paper is titled "Incomplete" as it only covers a tiny subset of Quantum Error Correction theory. Let's call it the core ideas. 
In some sense, I wrote this paper for my past self, who couldn't understand why drawing a 2D grid with horizontal and vertical lines 
would constitute a logical qubit in the stabilizer formalism. That said, I hope the paper helps anyone who stumbles upon it[^1].

[^1]: I initially wanted to publish the paper on arxiv but withdrew my submission since the paper kind of lacks substance. In other words, it isn't _good enough_.

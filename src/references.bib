	abstract = {We propose a method for universal fault-tolerant quantum computation using concatenated quantum error correcting codes. Namely, other than computational basis state preparation as required by the DiVincenzo criteria [1], our scheme requires no special ancillary state preparation to achieve universality, as opposed to schemes such as magic state distillation. The concatenation scheme exploits the transversal properties of two different codes, combining them to provide a means to protect against low-weight arbitrary errors. We give the required properties of the error correcting codes to ensure universal fault-tolerance and discuss a particular example using the 7-qubit Steane and 15-qubit Reed-Muller codes. We believe that optimizing the codes used in such a scheme could provide a useful alternative to state distillation schemes that exhibit high overhead costs.},

	abstract = {Steane's 7-qubit quantum error-correcting code admits a set of fault-tolerant gates that generate the Clifford group, which in itself is not universal for quantum computation. The 15-qubit Reed-Muller code also does not admit a universal fault-tolerant gate set but possesses fault-tolerant T and control-control-Z gates. Combined with the Clifford group, either of these two gates generate a universal set. Here, we combine these two features by demonstrating how to fault-tolerantly convert between these two codes, providing a new method to realize universal fault-tolerant quantum computation. One interpretation of our result is that both codes correspond to the same subsystem code in different gauges. Our scheme extends to the entire family of quantum Reed-Muller codes.},

            The quantum circuit model is the de-facto way of designing quantum algorithms. Yet any level of abstraction away from the underlying hardware incurs overhead. In this work, we develop quantum algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation "one level below” the circuit model, exploiting the underlying control over qubit interactions available in most quantum hardware and deriving analytic circuit identities for synthesising multi-qubit evolutions from two-qubit interactions. We then analyse the impact of these techniques under the standard error model where errors occur per gate, and an error model with a constant error rate per unit time. To quantify the benefits of this approach, we apply it to time-dynamics simulation of the 2D spin Fermi-Hubbard model. Combined with new error bounds for Trotter product formulas tailored to the non-asymptotic regime and an analysis of error propagation, we find that e.g. for a 5 × 5 Fermi-Hubbard lattice we reduce the circuit depth from 1, 243, 586 using the best previous fermion encoding and error bounds in the literature, to 3, 209 in the per-gate error model, or the circuit-depth-equivalent to 259 in the per-time error model. This brings Hamiltonian simulation, previously beyond reach of current hardware for non-trivial examples, significantly closer to being feasible in the NISQ era.},

            Universal quantum computers are potentially an ideal setting for simulating many-body quantum dynamics that is out of reach for classical digital computers. We use state-of-the-art IBM quantum computers to study paradigmatic examples of condensed matter physics—we simulate the effects of disorder and interactions on quantum particle transport, as well as correlation and entanglement spreading. Our benchmark results show that the quality of the current machines is below what is necessary for quantitatively accurate continuous-time dynamics of observables and reachable system sizes are small comparable to exact diagonalization. Despite this, we are successfully able to demonstrate clear qualitative behaviour associated with localization physics and many-body interaction effects.},

Our goal is to determine for which \${\textbackslash}rho\$ universal quantum computation (UQC) can be efficiently simulated. To answer this question, we construct purification protocols that consume several copies of \${\textbackslash}rho\$ and produce a single output qubit with higher polarization. The protocols allow one to increase the polarization only along certain "magic" directions. If the polarization of \${\textbackslash}rho\$ along a magic direction exceeds a threshold value (about 65\%), the purification asymptotically yields a pure state, which we call a magic state. We show that the Clifford group operations combined with magic states preparation are sufficient for UQC. The connection of our results with the Gottesman-Knill theorem is discussed.},

We find that our scheme produces better magic states than those that can be prepared using the individual qubits of the device.

Moreover, we show that the yield of magic states can be increased using adaptive circuits, in which the circuit elements are changed depending on the outcome of mid-circuit measurements. This demonstrates an essential capability needed for many error-correction subroutines. We believe that our prototype will be invaluable in the future as it can reduce the number of physical qubits needed to produce high-fidelity magic states in large-scale quantum-computing architectures.},

	abstract = {Quantum Error Correction will be necessary for preserving coherent states against noise and other unwanted interactions in quantum computation and communication. We develop a general theory of quantum error correction based on encoding states into larger Hilbert spaces subject to known interactions. We obtain necessary and suﬃcient conditions for the perfect recovery of an encoded state after its degradation by an interaction. The conditions depend only on the behavior of the logical states. We use them to give a recovery operator independent deﬁnition of error-correcting codes. We relate this deﬁnition to four others: The existence of a left inverse of the interaction, an explicit representation of the error syndrome using tensor products, perfect recovery of the completely entangled state, and an information theoretic identity. Two notions of ﬁdelity and error for imperfect recovery are introduced, one for pure and the other for entangled states. The latter is more appropriate when using codes in a quantum memory or in applications of quantum teleportation to communication. We show that the error for entangled states is bounded linearly by the error for pure states. A formal deﬁnition of independent interactions for qubits is given. This leads to lower bounds on the number of qubits required to correct e errors and a formal proof that the classical bounds on the probability of error of e-error-correcting codes applies to e-errorcorrecting quantum codes, provided that the interaction is dominated by an identity component.},

	abstract = {Quantum computers can be protected from noise by encoding the logical quantum information redundantly into multiple qubits using error correcting codes. When manipulating the logical quantum states, it is imperative that errors caused by imperfect operations do not spread uncontrollably through the quantum register. This requires that all operations on the quantum register obey a fault-tolerant circuit design which, in general, increases the complexity of the implementation. Here, we demonstrate a fault-tolerant universal set of gates on two logical qubits in a trapped-ion quantum computer. In particular, we make use of the recently introduced paradigm of flag fault tolerance, where the absence or presence of dangerous errors is heralded by usage of few ancillary 'flag' qubits. We perform a logical two-qubit CNOT-gate between two instances of the seven qubit color code, and we also fault-tolerantly prepare a logical magic state. We then realize a fault-tolerant logical T-gate by injecting the magic state via teleportation from one logical qubit onto the other. We observe the hallmark feature of fault tolerance, a superior performance compared to a non-fault-tolerant implementation. In combination with recently demonstrated repeated quantum error correction cycles these results open the door to error-corrected universal quantum computation.},

	abstract = {Quantum states are very delicate, so it is likely some sort of quantum error correction will be necessary to build reliable quantum computers. The theory of quantum error-correcting codes has some close ties to and some striking diﬀerences from the theory of classical error-correcting codes. Many quantum codes can be described in terms of the stabilizer of the codewords. The stabilizer is a ﬁnite Abelian group, and allows a straightforward characterization of the error-correcting properties of the code. The stabilizer formalism for quantum codes also illustrates the relationships to classical coding theory, particularly classical codes over GF(4), the ﬁnite ﬁeld with four elements. To build a quantum computer which behaves correctly in the presence of errors, we also need a theory of fault-tolerant quantum computation, instructing us how to perform quantum gates on qubits which are encoded in a quantum errorcorrecting code. The threshold theorem states that it is possible to create a quantum computer to perform an arbitrary quantum computation provided the error rate per physical gate or time step is below some constant threshold value.},

By definition, transversal operators do not couple physical subsystems within the same code block. Consequently, such operators do not spread errors within code blocks and are, therefore, fault tolerant. Nonetheless, other methods of ensuring fault tolerance are required, as it is invariably the case that some encoded gates cannot be implemented transversally. This observation has led to a long-standing conjecture that transversal encoded gate sets cannot be universal. Here we show that the ability of a quantum code to detect an arbitrary error on any single physical subsystem is incompatible with the existence of a universal, transversal encoded gate set for the code.},

	abstract = {In the current Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era of quantum computing, qubit technologies are prone to imperfections, giving rise to various errors such as gate errors, decoherence/dephasing, measurement errors, leakage, and crosstalk. These errors present challenges in achieving errorfree computation within NISQ devices. A proposed solution to this issue is Quantum Error Correction (QEC), which aims to rectify the corrupted qubit state through a three-step process: (i) detection: identifying the presence of an error, (ii) decoding: pinpointing the location(s) of the affected qubit(s), and (iii) correction: restoring the faulty qubits to their original states. QEC is an expanding ﬁeld of research that encompasses intricate concepts. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of the historical context, current state, and future prospects of Quantum Error Correction, tailored to cater to computer scientists with limited familiarity with quantum physics and its associated mathematical concepts. In this work, we, (a) explain the foundational principles of QEC and explore existing Quantum Error Correction Codes (QECC) designed to correct errors in qubits, (b) explore the practicality of these QECCs concerning implementation and error correction quality, and (c) highlight the challenges associated with implementing QEC within the context of the current landscape of NISQ computers.},

A formalism describing the evolution of operators rather than states has proven extremely fruitful in understanding an important class of quantum operations.

I argue in this paper that this conclusion is misleading. First, the statement of the theorem (that the particular set of quantum operations in question can be simulated using a classical computer) is, on reﬂection, already evident when we consider Bell’s and related inequalities in the context of a discussion of computational machines. This, in turn, helps us to understand that the appropriate conclusion to draw from the Gottesman-Knill theorem is not that entanglement is insuﬃcient to enable a quantum performance advantage, but rather that if we limit ourselves to the operations referred to in the Gottesman-Knill theorem, we will not have used the resources provided by an entangled quantum system to their full potential.},

An extension of this result is that adding \$n\$ control inputs to a controlled gate requires \$4n\$ \$T\$ gates, whereas the best prior result was \$8n\$. The second contribution is a quantum circuit for the Toffoli gate which can detect a single \${\textbackslash}sigma{\textasciicircum}z\$ error occurring with probability \$p\$ in any one of eight \$T\$ gates required to produce the Toffoli. By post-selecting circuits that did not detect an error, the posterior error probability is suppressed to lowest order from \$4p\$ (or \$7p\$, without the first contribution) to \$28p{\textasciicircum}2\$ for this enhanced construction.

              Realizing the potential of quantum computing requires sufficiently low logical error rates

              promises to bridge this divide by distributing quantum logical information across many physical qubits in such a way that errors can be detected and corrected. Errors on the encoded logical qubit state can be exponentially suppressed as the number of physical qubits grows, provided that the physical error rates are below a certain threshold and stable over the course of a computation. Here we implement one-dimensional repetition codes embedded in a two-dimensional grid of superconducting qubits that demonstrate exponential suppression of bit-flip or phase-flip errors, reducing logical error per round more than 100-fold when increasing the number of qubits from 5 to 21. Crucially, this error suppression is stable over 50 rounds of error correction. We also introduce a method for analysing error correlations with high precision, allowing us to characterize error locality while performing quantum error correction. Finally, we perform error detection with a small logical qubit using the 2D surface code on the same device
              18,19
              and show that the results from both one- and two-dimensional codes agree with numerical simulations that use a simple depolarizing error model. These experimental demonstrations provide a foundation for building a scalable fault-tolerant quantum computer with superconducting qubits.},

              Topologically ordered matter exhibits long-range quantum entanglement. However, measuring this entanglement in real materials is extremely tricky.

          , 
            The discovery of topological order has revised the understanding of quantum matter and provided the theoretical foundation for many quantum error–correcting codes. Realizing topologically ordered states has proven to be challenging in both condensed matter and synthetic quantum systems. We prepared the ground state of the toric code Hamiltonian using an efficient quantum circuit on a superconducting quantum processor. We measured a topological entanglement entropy near the expected value of –ln2 and simulated anyon interferometry to extract the braiding statistics of the emergent excitations. Furthermore, we investigated key aspects of the surface code, including logical state injection and the decay of the nonlocal order parameter. Our results demonstrate the potential for quantum processors to provide insights into topological quantum matter and quantum error correction.},

            Topological error correcting codes, and particularly the surface code, currently provide the most feasible road-map towards large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation. As such, obtaining fast and flexible decoding algorithms for these codes, within the experimentally realistic and challenging context of faulty syndrome measurements, without requiring any final read-out of the physical qubits, is of critical importance. In this work, we show that the problem of decoding such codes can be naturally reformulated as a process of repeated interactions between a decoding agent and a code environment, to which the machinery of reinforcement learning can be applied to obtain decoding agents. While in principle this framework can be instantiated with environments modelling circuit level noise, we take a first step towards this goal by using deepQ learning to obtain decoding agents for a variety of simplified phenomenological noise models, which yield faulty syndrome measurements without including the propagation of errors which arise in full circuit level noise models.},
